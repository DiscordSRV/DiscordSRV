# Channel links from game to Discord
# syntax is Channels: {"in-game channel name from Minecraft": "numerical channel ID from Discord", "another in-game channel name from Minecraft": "another numerical channel ID from Discord"}
#
# All of DiscordSRV's messages will go to the first channel unless there's a channel for that type of messages defined:
# when using a compatible chat plugin, the channel name will be the one from that plugin (for chat messages)
#  - If you're using TownyChat, the default channel is usually called "general" instead of "global"
# for player chat messages (when not using a chat plugin): global
# for server start/stop messages: status
# for achievement/advancement messages: awards
# for death messages: deaths
# for join messages: join
# for leave messages: leave
# for dynmap messages: dynmap
# for watchdog messages: watchdog
# for /discord broadcast: broadcasts (unless specified in the command)
#
# The first part of channel pairs is not the Discord channel name!
# You must restart your server after changing this option
